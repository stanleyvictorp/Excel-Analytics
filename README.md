# Data Cleaning and Merging using VLOOKUP, INDEX_MATCH, XLOOKUP:

Dataset : The 'product_sales_db.xlsx' file contains 3 tables:

3. "customer": This table contains information about the customers who have placed orders, including their customer ID and name.

# Objectives by the Stakeholders

## Objective 1:

For orders table:

	- Eliminate duplicate 'order_id' to prevent double-counting in data analysis.

	- Convert the data type of 'product_id' from number to Text.

	- To address data entry issues, replace the incorrect entries in the 'qty' field that end with "Q" and append the corrected values as necessary.

	- Substitute any empty values in the 'qty' column with the text 'Not Available'.

For the products table:

	- Remove all the extra leading and trailing spaces in product_name. (Hint: use TRIM() function)

	- split the 'price (in Rs)' column at the 'â‚¹' symbol and extract the numerical values. 

	  Rename the columns appropriately after completing this task.

For the customer table:

	- Convert all customer names to lowercase.

	- Copy all customer name values, then paste them permanently using 'Paste Special' -> 'Values'.

## Objective 2:

1. Retrieve all the customer names that correspond to their respective 'customer_id' listed in the orders table.

2. Retrieve all the product names that correspond to their respective 'product_id' listed in the orders table.

3. Obtain the corresponding 'price (in Rs)' of the products listed in the orders table.

4. Calculate the product of 'qty' and 'price (in INR)'# Excel-Analytics
